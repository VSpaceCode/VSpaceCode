# Setting up

Welcome to VSpaceCode. You need to set up some settings and keybindings to get started.

ðŸ’¡ Click [Configure for you](command:vspacecode.configure) or you can set up manually by reading our [documentation](command:vspacecode.openDocumentationUrl) if you want to retain the formatting in `settings.json` and `keybindings.json`.
