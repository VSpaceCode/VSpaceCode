## [0.4.0] - 2020-06-21

### Added

- Implement transient menu
- Add `<spc> z` for zoom menu
- Add `<spc> 1...8` to focus different editor groups
- Add `<spc> b` for buffers/editors menu
- Add `<spc> e` for errors menu
- Add `<spc> v` for smart selection
- Add `<spc> *` to search with input
- Add `<spc> !` to show terminal
- Add `<spc> i` for insert menu
- Add `<spc> s` for search/symbol menu
- Add `<spc> p` for project menu
- Implement `args` key in the bindings to executes command(s) with args
For example, the follow the binding will map `y` in the menu to `y y` in vim to yank a line by passing a `args` for that command.

```jsonc
{
    "key": "y",
    "name": "Yank a line",
    "type": "command",
    "command": "vim.remap",
    "args": {
      "after": ["y", "y"]
    }
},
```

In this example: Only the second command has args. When `args` is used with `commands`, the `args` is expected to be an array. If the `null` is not present in the follow example, the first command (`formatDocument`) will receive the second element of `args` instead.

```jsonc
{
    "key": "=",
    "name": "Yank a line",
    "type": "commands",
    "commands": ["editor.action.formatDocument", "vim.remap"],
    "args": [
      null,
      { "after": ["y", "y"]}
    ]
},
```
