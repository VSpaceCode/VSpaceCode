# Contributing Guide

Thank you for taking the time to contributing to VSpaceCode.

## Philosophy

This extension aims to provide the best out-of-the-box experience like spacemacs. As much as we would like, there is going to be differences in how things like key bindings are handled. We will try to provide escape hatch whenever we can to allow customization.
